# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lorachain is a lightweight blockchain network designed for cryptocurrency transactions in communities with limited internet connectivity using LoRa mesh networking technology. It operates on a hybrid architecture with light clients (mobile wallets) and synchronized nodes (full nodes).

The blockchain uses a **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model** for transaction management and supports **cryptographic signing** with both ECDSA (secp256k1) and Ed25519 algorithms.

**Current Development Status**: ~60-65% complete toward MVP goal with Milestone 1 (Core Blockchain) fully implemented, Milestone 2 (LoRa/Mesh Protocol) completed, and significant progress on Milestone 3 (Network Layer & P2P) with UTXO sync protocol v2.0.0 implementation. See `specs/ROADMAP.md` for detailed progress tracking.

## Important Development Guidelines

- **NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**: This project prioritizes clean, modern implementations. Do not maintain backwards compatibility with older versions or deprecated features. When making changes, feel free to break existing APIs and update all dependent code accordingly.
- **UTXO-ONLY**: The blockchain exclusively uses the UTXO model. Account-based transactions are not supported.
- **CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY**: All transactions must be properly signed using the CryptographicService with either secp256k1 or ed25519 algorithms.

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-Testing Checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Before running unit tests in any app or package, ensure all dependent packages are built:

```bash
# Always build shared packages first (dependency order)
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/shared" build
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" build

# Then build other packages if needed
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mesh-protocol" build
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mobile-wallet" build
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/node" build

# Then run tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mobile-wallet" test
pnpm --filter "wallet-app" test
pnpm --filter "node-server" test
```

### Why This Matters

- **Shared packages** (`@lorachain/shared`, `@lorachain/core`) are consumed by apps as compiled JavaScript
- **Source changes** in these packages don't automatically trigger rebuilds
- **Test failures** may occur if consuming apps use outdated compiled versions
- **UTXO transaction validation** issues are common when `@lorachain/core` is not rebuilt after changes
- **Cryptographic signature verification** may fail if core packages aren't properly compiled

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Build dependencies and run all tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/shared" build && pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" build && pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:unit                                          # Run all unit tests
pnpm test:integration                                   # Run all integration tests

# Individual package testing (after building dependencies)
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:unit               # Run core unit tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:integration        # Run core integration tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:coverage           # Run core tests with coverage
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mobile-wallet" test:unit      # Run mobile wallet unit tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mesh-protocol" test:unit      # Run mesh protocol unit tests
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/node" test:unit               # Run node unit tests
pnpm --filter "wallet-app" test:unit                    # Run wallet app unit tests
pnpm --filter "node-server" test:unit                   # Run node server unit tests

# Watch mode testing (after building dependencies)
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:unit:watch         # Unit tests watch mode
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:integration:watch  # Integration tests watch mode
pnpm --filter "@lorachain/mobile-wallet" test:unit:watch # Mobile wallet watch mode
```

### IMPORTANT Testing Best Practices

**⚠️ Critical Testing Guidelines:**

1. **ALWAYS check current directory with `pwd` before using `cd`**: This prevents "no such file or directory" errors by ensuring you know your current location before attempting navigation:

   ```bash
   # ✅ CORRECT: Always check where you are first
   pwd  # Check current directory
   # Output: /Users/greco/Documents/lorachain/packages/core
   cd ../..  # Navigate relative to current location

   # ❌ WRONG: Blindly changing directories without checking location
   cd packages/core  # May fail if already in packages/core!
   ```

2. **Always use `test:run` for single-run testing**: The default `test` command runs in watch mode and will wait indefinitely for file changes, causing timeouts in automated environments.

3. **Avoid unnecessary directory changes**: When already in the project root, use filter commands instead of `cd` to avoid "no such file or directory" errors:

   ```bash
   # ❌ WRONG: Don't change to directories that don't exist relative to current location
   cd packages/core && pnpm test

   # ✅ CORRECT: Use filter commands from project root
   pnpm --filter "@lorachain/core" test:run
   ```

4. **Build dependencies before testing**: Always build shared packages first to avoid test failures due to outdated compiled versions.

5. **Use appropriate test commands**:
   - `test` - Run full test suite (unit + integration)
   - `test:unit` - Run unit tests only
   - `test:unit:watch` - Unit tests in watch mode
   - `test:integration` - Run integration tests only (core package)
   - `test:integration:watch` - Integration tests in watch mode (core package)
   - `test:run` - Single test execution (deprecated, use test:unit or test:integration)

### Dependency Build Order

The Lorachain monorepo has the following dependency hierarchy:

1. **`@lorachain/shared`** - Base utilities (no dependencies)
2. **`@lorachain/core`** - Core blockchain logic (depends on shared)
3. **`@lorachain/mesh-protocol`** - LoRa communication (depends on core, shared)
4. **`@lorachain/mobile-wallet`** - Mobile wallet (depends on core, mesh-protocol, shared)
5. **`@lorachain/node`** - Full node (depends on core, mesh-protocol, shared)
6. **Apps** - wallet-app, node-server (depend on all packages)

Always build in dependency order when testing specific packages that depend on others.
