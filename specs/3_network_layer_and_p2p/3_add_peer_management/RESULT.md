## Configuration Options

The peer management system is highly configurable through the `PeerManagerConfig` interface:

```typescript
interface PeerManagerConfig {
  discovery: PeerDiscoveryConfig;
  connectionPool: ConnectionPoolConfig; 
  scoring: ScoringConfig;
  misbehavior: MisbehaviorConfig;
  enableAutoOptimization: boolean;
  optimizationInterval: number;
}
```

Default configurations are provided for immediate usability while allowing full customization for specific network requirements.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { EnhancedLorachainNode } from '@lorachain/node';

const node = new EnhancedLorachainNode({
  id: 'my-node',
  port: 8333,
  host: 'localhost', 
  type: 'full',
  enablePeerManagement: true,
  peerManager: {
    discovery: {
      dnsSeeds: ['seed1.lorachain.network'],
      enablePeerExchange: true,
      enableMeshAnnounce: true
    },
    connectionPool: {
      maxConnections: 50,
      maxOutbound: 30,
      maxInbound: 20
    }
  }
});

await node.start();
```
